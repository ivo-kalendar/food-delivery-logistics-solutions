## 🧩 Core Capabilities & Access Control

The platform is engineered with a multi-layered security architecture that dictates data interaction based on user verification status.

### 🛡️ Authentication & Authorization Logic
The system implements advanced authentication on both the Frontend and Backend:
* **Guest Access**: Unauthenticated users are restricted to Login and Registration screens only.
* **Pending Approval State**: New registrants enter a "restricted" mode. Although they can enter the dashboard, all functional routes (Tables, Drivers, Prints) are blocked by the ```adminApproved.js``` middleware until an Administrator manually grants access.
* **Authorized User Tier**: Once approved, users unlock:
    - **Home Dashboard**: View the latest live delivery document globally.
    - **Document Ownership**: Create, edit, delete, and print their own logistics manifests.
    - **Global Archive**: Access all historical tables with the ability to clone them into new working drafts.
* **Super Admin Tier**: Full system sovereignty. Beyond standard features, the Admin can:
    - Overwrite or delete any table in the database.
    - Manage the user registry (Approve/Block/Delete accounts).
    - Perform full CRUD on the Employee (Driver) database, including modifying core properties and status.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture & Advanced Workflow

### Independent Backend Engine
The backend is designed as a **decoupled API service**. Its modular structure allows it to function independently of the React frontend, serving as a secure data provider for any external service. It utilizes a **Singleton Pattern** for MongoDB connections to ensure persistent, high-performance database pooling.

### Logistics Data Lifecycle
* **Smart Table Replication**: Users can utilize the ```getAndCopyTable``` controller. This logic performs a deep clone of previous route assignments, driver IDs, and commercial zones, migrating them to a new timestamp to eliminate manual daily entry.
* **Complex Data Aggregation**: The ```Tables.getOneByID``` model performs automated joins between the ```tables```, ```vraboteni```, and ```korisnici``` collections to deliver a complete manifest object in a single request.
* **State Synchronization**: The frontend utilizes a complex ```useReducer``` + ```Context API``` pattern. This ensures that when a dispatcher updates a driver's status or a delivery comment, the change is reflected instantly across all connected UI components.
* **High-Performance Middleware**: 
    - ```auth.js```: JWT verification layer.
    - ```adminApproved.js```: Permission-based gatekeeper for logistics data.
    - ```compression()```: Gzip encoding for large JSON table payloads.

## 📂 Project Architecture & Full-Stack Structure

The application follows a strictly organized, nested architecture. The ```client``` (React/Vite) is housed directly within the ```server``` (Node/Express) root, ensuring that the backend provides both the API services and the static asset serving logic.

```

### 🛠️ Architectural Integrity
* **The Controller-Model Pattern**: The ```controllers/``` handle HTTP logic, while the ```models/``` handle the heavy-lifting of MongoDB queries (Native Driver). This ensures the backend remains decoupled and fast.
* **Nested Client Logic**: By keeping the ```client/``` within the server, the project can be deployed as a single unit where the backend serves the ```dist/``` folder in production.
* **Centralized State**: The ```context/``` folder in the client acts as the single source of truth, synchronized with the backend through RESTful calls defined in ```router.js```.
* **Singleton Database Pattern**: The database is initialized once in ```server.js``` and exported, preventing the "Too many connections" error in high-traffic logistics environments.

### 🧩 Deep Dive: Client Component Architecture

The frontend is built using a modular component pattern, where UI elements are separated by their functional responsibility (Auth, Layout, Navigation, and Views).

### 🛠️ Component Design Principles:

* **Granular Layout Logic**: The ```layout/``` folder contains the actual "engine" of the app. Components like ```SelectedTable``` and ```SelectedItem``` manage complex prop-drilling and state synchronization for every single cell in the logistics grid.
* **Role-Based Visibility**: The components in the ```links/``` folder dynamically render based on the ```AuthState```, ensuring users only see what they are authorized to access.
* **Declarative Routing**: The ```pages/``` directory contains the main "screens" of the app, which are wrapped in protection layers (e.g., ```AdminRoutes```) to prevent unauthorized DOM rendering.
* **Data-Driven UI**: ```CardList``` and ```CardTable``` work together to transform raw JSON data from the ```/api/tables``` endpoint into a searchable, interactive archive.
* **Optimized Printing**: The ```SelectedTable``` component is specifically styled to work with ```react-to-print```, ensuring a clean A4 export by hiding non-essential layout elements like the Navbar and Action buttons.

## ⚙️ Business & Logistics Logic

The platform handles the complexity of a food delivery day through several specialized modules:

### 🛡️ Access Control Matrix

| Layer | Middleware | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Auth** | `auth.js` | JWT Extraction and basic identity verification. |
| **Approval** | `adminApproved.js` | Verifies the user is cleared by HQ to manage schedules. |
| **SuperAdmin** | `admin.js` | Critical operations: `/allusers`, `/korisnik/:id`, `/vraboten/nov`. |

### 📋 Logistics Entities

| Entity | Description | Attributes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Table** | The daily manifest | `tableArr`, `tableComment`, `authorID`, `date`. |
| **Vraboten** | Employee Registry | `ime`, `prezime`, `pozicija`, `status`. |
| **Options** | Dynamic Dropdowns | `hours`, `comments`, `komercial`, `drivers`. |

---

## 🔚 Primary API Reference

### 🏗️ Logistics & Table Operations
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **POST** | `/api/table/new` | Initialize a fresh daily manifest. |
| **POST** | `/api/copytable/new` | Clone a previous table with all driver assignments. |
| **PUT** | `/api/table/removedrivers/:id` | Bulk remove driver assignments for a specific day. |
| **PUT** | `/api/table-comment/:id` | Append HQ operational comments to the schedule. |

### 👥 HR & User Management
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GET** | `/api/vraboteni` | Fetch all active employees for assignment. |
| **PUT** | `/api/korisnik/:id` | Update user permissions/approval status *(Admin)*. |
| **DELETE** | `/api/deletetable/:id` | Wipe a manifest from history *(Admin)*. |

---

## 🛠️ Internal Workflow Examples

### 1. Generating a Daily Schedule
The frontend triggers `addNewTable`, which fetches active options for hours and commercial zones, creating a JSON manifest that is then distributed to all approved users.

### 2. The Printing Process
Utilizing `react-to-print` with `componentRef`:
```javascript
const handlePrint = useReactToPrint({
    contentRef: componentRef,
    documentTitle: "Dostava-Manifest-" + today
});
```
This ensures that the printed version hides navigation elements and optimizes the table for physical delivery logs.

---

## 🧪 Technical Implementation Highlights

* **MongoDB Singleton Pattern:** The database connection is established once in `server.js` and exported as a persistent client to prevent connection leaks.
* **Modern React Rendering:** Fully migrated to `createRoot` API (React 18/19 compatibility) for concurrent rendering.
* **Compression Middleware:** Backend uses `compression()` for Gzip encoding, significantly reducing the payload size of large logistics tables.
* **Moment.js Integration:** Deeply integrated with `moment/locale/mk` for localized Macedonian date formatting (e.g., "Понеделник", "Петок").
